    <p>The giant panda is the featured animal on the logo for World 
      Wildlife Fund as a symbol of all endangered species that would 
      be able to thrive if permitted the range and natural environment 
      of their origin.</p>
    <p>Our logo is representative of World Wildlife Fund's commitment 
      to protect wildlife and wild spaces. This is a commitment that 
      utilizes all the talent, resources, and bright solutions available 
      to preserve important species and spaces of the earth. World Wildlife
      Fund is the largest privately supported international conservation 
      organization in the world with more than 1.2 million members in the
      United States. Since its inception in 1961, World Wildlife Fund has
      invested in over ten thousand projects in 157 countries. World Wildlife 
      Fund directs its conservation efforts toward three global initiatives:
      protecting endangered spaces, saving endangered species, and addressing 
      global threats. From working to save the giant panda, tiger, and rhino,
      to helping establish and manage parks and wildlife reserves, World Wildlife 
      Fund continues to thrive at the forefront of environmental conservation.</p>

    <p>WWF’s work has evolved from saving species and landscapes to 
      addressing the larger global threats and forces that impact them. 
      Recognizing that the problems facing our planet are increasingly 
      more complex and urgent, we have refined the way in which we work 
      around an ambitious new strategy. Our new strategy puts people at 
      the center and organizes our work around six key areas: forests, 
      marine, freshwater, wildlife, food and climate. By linking these 
      six areas in an integrated approach, we can better leverage our 
      unique assets and direct all our resources to protecting vulnerable 
      places, species and communities worldwide. People are at the center 
      of our work because together we can change the trajectory of the 
      threats to nature, and help ensure nature’s ability to provide—for 
      the sake of every living thing, including ourselves. To accomplish 
      our ambitious goals, we work to educate and influence people into 
      making sustainable choices and decisions, including those who work 
      in business and make decisions around the use of natural resources, 
      and those who work in government and set policy that impacts nature. 
      We work globally at every level—in the field and in the local community, 
      from the halls of government to the global marketplace. One of WWF’s 
      strengths is our ability to engage stakeholders—in business, civil 
      society, and academia—in partnerships to devise innovative solutions 
      to the issues that challenge us. Working together with 1.1 million 
      supporters , WWF’s partners, projects and experts are making a 
      difference in creating a healthy future for our planet.</p>
